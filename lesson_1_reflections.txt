How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It  easy way to find only places  where  something was changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It  hellp save  time  for  searching bugs  and  tracing  changes in code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros:  you can choose size  of  commit  by yourself
	   you can organize you commit loggically
Const: You can  fogget doing commits
       Your  commits can has  bad size
	   Some timex  its really good  to  autosave  changes
	   
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Reason is  simple: this is  differnt  stategy of  comit one  phisical, other one is logical.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can  use log command  for  searching for  commits. they  are  order from  latest to earliest
When I found  commit I can  compare with diff. for this  i shoud  now  commits ids and use they  as  parameters for dif

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can  easy find   bad  changes  and fix  it
